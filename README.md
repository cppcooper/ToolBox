# ToolBox
My local C++ libraries, chances are that any other of my project repos uses this.

# Status
Will it build? Nope. Maybe the `old-master` branch, but I'm skeptical.
Is it useful anymore? Nope, that's why it doesn't build.
Will it ever build? Probably not. If I ever need any of the things this offered I will probably replace the repo with a new one built from scratch.
Why don't I delete it? Uhh, good question. Posterity?
