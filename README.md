# Toolbox (old-master)
This is branch is the only remnants of this repo before being nuked. The git object count was ~4750 which has been reduced to ~419 the day this was done. (~500MiB -> ~4MiB)

A lot of content was purged via `git filter-branch` and this is what remains. The source code, including cheryl-engine (ie. the main reason for keeping this around, since this is currently the last build-able state)
