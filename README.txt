Everything here works, with the exception of iof_chunk. It used to work and then I decided to start redesigning it and not finish.

These are the tools I've created and used in my projects to work faster. The most recent additions are the GF, GFX, and _Projects folders. I stripped out all my game code and fashioned a library out of my home grown engine. It comes in three parts, the GL_Engine which acts as a base, the Asset Management which I refer to as Faculties, and the Game Framework which is, well you can guess.

I've started a long process of converting projects over to use this set of libraries to reduce their code bases. The plan is to create a portfolio with it all which could be browsed with greater ease. It is going well so far but I have a long ways to go because the first project was incomplete to begin with.
